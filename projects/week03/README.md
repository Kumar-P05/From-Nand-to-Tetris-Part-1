# Project 3

Given a Data Flip Flop chip and all chips built in [`Project 1`](../week01/README.md) and [`Project 2`](../week02/README.md), build the following chips:

* [`Bit`](./a/Bit.hdl)
* [`Register`](./a/Register.hdl)
* [`RAM8`](./a/RAM8.hdl)
* [`RAM64`](./a/RAM64.hdl)
* [`RAM512`](./b/RAM512.hdl)
* [`RAM4K`](./b/RAM4K.hdl)
* [`RAM16K`](./b/RAM16K.hdl)
* [`PC`](./a/PC.hdl)

Note: The project 3 files are located in two folders named [`'a'`](./a) and [`'b'`](./b). This technical detail speeds up the simulation and testing of the project 3 chips. However, when you submit your work in a zip file, put all the files together, and not inside any folders. 

You need to pack all of the above chips and upload it as [`project3.zip`](./Submission/project3.zip) located in [`Submission folder`](./Submission)
