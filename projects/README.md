# Projects

This folder contains the solutions to the assignments of [this course](/README.md). 

Each week's solution is stored in a separate folder. The folder structure is as follows:

- [`./week00`](/projects/week00/readme.md)
- [`./week01`](/projects/week01/readme.md)
- [`./week02`](/projects/week02/readme.md)
- [`./week03`](/projects/week03/readme.md)
- [`./week04`](/projects/week04/readme.md)
- [`./week05`](/projects/week05/readme.md)


To access the solution for a particular week, navigate to the corresponding folder above. Each week's folder has its own readme file that explains the details of the assignments.

Note: Week 6 is currently unavailable, as I have not yet completed the assessment.

`Submission` folder in each folder contains .zip files which is intended to be submited in the course submission portal.
